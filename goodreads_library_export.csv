It was part of my childhood and was one of the best in terms of suspense and visuals. Nonetheless, reading this book was a better experience than watching it. The characters, the details, and the climax were so different that you couldn’t help but like it more. I certainly feel that movie did a lot of stuff to masculine Alan Grant’s character while in books he was much more relatable and nicer in general? Even Malcolm’s character was much more than what they showed in movies and don’t even get me started on the Hammond’s character in the movie. Hollywood’s Idea to sympathise with rich billionaires will always go over my head. The book did a much better job in showing the capitalism at play and motivation behind Jurassic park itself. <br/>Would recommend all fans of this franchise to at least read this book once. <br/><br/>Loved it!",,,1,0

Depression, intrusive thoughts, struggle with self-image and also the ordeal of the oedipal battle with one’s father, were central themes that one finds in this book. And the author brought them out really well and presented a story, that is impactful and touches the heart in a way that I haven’t felt since reading Aristotle and Dante. This was a very similar book and also had themes of cultural identity embedded in it. And the beauty with which the author navigated the weight of family and culture, resonated with me on a personal level. It served as a reminder in these troubling times for me to get in touch with my roots and not worry about imposter syndrome that we all go through. <br/><br/>“Everyone wants you here. We have a saying in Farsi. It translates to ‘your place was empty.’ We say it when we miss somebody."" - there was a place empty for this book in my heart. <br/>",,,1,0

I needed this badly. Why? Cause I am a little ass crying bitch. This isn't a story that you go to when you need something thrilling, it is something that you know is coming and when it comes, it just hits you. Full of cliches and predictable storylines and yet it is needed, some things need to be said and he does it in style. I wish the world this book exists in, existed in real life, but that's the point, we will have to build one. I wish I had enough courage and means to hold on to someone as Ari does. I wish the world could be a sweeter place like Ari and Dante are envisioning. I wish so many things, and yet at the core of them, it is all for more love in this godforsaken love. Studying in a liberal college can push you to cynicism and existential dread but books like these remind you that it is all for people around you. <br/>I missed you, Ari and Dante and your fictional super cheesy dialogues.<br/>I will miss you again because you give me hope. <br/>I hope I can keep up with that hope. <br/>Thank you.

She knew that sex and power were inexorably linked, and she decreed that government officials and visiting dignitaries must pay homage to her imperial highness by performing cunnilingus upon her.""<br/><br/><br/>It is true that sex became penis oriented in 1800s under the guidance of clearly very well intended white cis het men, namely Mr Freud, more like a whiny bitch. This book not only covered the male ignorance but also provided stats to back it up. Most men when it comes to sex or oral sex in specific, rely on porn or first hand experience, which tbh is a big BS scenario. Lack of sexual education isn't only a health risk factor but can also deny us of one of the greatest human pleasures. How is one supposed to perform with their partner if they don't even know or understand what they performing on. Rarely any men outside academic circles would know that there are 18 parts to clitoris and every one of them can be differently simulated. Heck, even half the girls in my country wouldn't know that. The taboo around sex in this country isn't just an academic failure but also a social and cultural failure. <br/><br/>I hope that every man atleast reads this book once in their life, preferably before they start dating. Because understanding your partner and understanding the respect that comes with someone letting you go down on them, is of utmost importance and vital to any relationship.",,,1,0

He talks about how one Sikh is worth 1.25 lakh individuals. One thing to notice here is, he didn't say a man, he said an individual. Sikhism has always valued the ferocity of not only its male members but also female members, and this is what this story was about. <br/><br/>The way the author captured the subject of honour killings with an air of caution and lesson, was just phenomenal. Every single page of this book identified different ways our thoughts are moulded with the restrictions we grow up with as an Indian. From the ridiculous shaming of women over their own choices to the ridiculous responsibilities of marrying someone (reflected in the case of Mindi and Jason) for the sake of the community. The author took the whole deal with a hint of humour and presented the most taboo topics in the Sikh community bare open. <br/><br/>Whether it was the treatment of widows or the patriarchal oppression of some sects or what some would call sacrilegious stories (I mean they were discussing it all in a Gurudwara, so XD), the author didn't shy away from embracing rebellious energy in the face of traditional undertakings. Each of her main characters was a rebel on their own terms, even if it was a small gesture of standing up for your daughter when claiming bragging rights would have been easier. <br/><br/>The issues she talked about and the way she talked about them, was so beautifully woven, that I couldn't keep the book down. It was perfectly paced and filled with enough suspense and excitement for me to keep reading late in the night. Even though I still have a tough time believing that old aunties of my locality would dabble in stories like these, it is still something that every human thinks of, and why would they be any different? <br/><br/>I hope more people read this book and not shy away from the title. I think the author gambled big time with a title like that but I understand why she would do that, to erase a taboo, you first have to embrace it wholeheartedly! ",,,1,0

Even though it was filled with plot holes, a little cliches, very slow pace and a love triangle (Obviously open ended, cause no love triangle is possible between straight couples xD), it held up its end pretty good but not good enough. The premise was so good, a Faustian deal, and yet it came down to a man-child and a 300 year old teenager, who didn't change in whole time. But then again if you are doomed to be not remembered, there is no need to change, is there?<br/><br/>I would have asked for knowledge if I could make the deal but I wasn't in her shoes, I wouldn't know what it is like to have your existence be curbed into a single house, but maybe I do a little.  Her choice made sense, her defiance made sense too but in the end, the game wasn't worth it because it wasn't fair, it was mercy. The whole book, you keep looking for things to happen, by 70 percent, you are still learning about the initial circumstances which don't even tie to ending as much as they should. The potential to be a story of century, it just succumbed to a cliche young adult love story. <br/><br/>But nevertheless, I loved the concept behind it and loved that being human is leaving a mark, loved that ideas can matter more than your existence and that no matter what a love triangle is only possible way to sell books xD",true,,1,0

But it was a fun experience, the VR of Oasis seems like a fun place, a universe full of possibilities so maybe I would revisit it someday with the second book but not now. Ernest Cline felt like he was trying to create a fantasy of every salty nerd nice guy come true (I know a few who would relate to the main character xD) but even then book isn't that bad. Some instances of riddle solving were well written while other stuff was just outright fangirling without any context or necessary requirement.
